# Italian-plurals-and-articles
A Python notebook in Jupyter to find the correct plural forms and articles of an Italian word

Italian plurals and articles seem much easier than they are in reality. Use this tool to find out the correct way just by inputting the word and its gender.

Note that composite words or certain exceptions might not be properly processed!
